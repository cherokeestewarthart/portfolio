  <ul> 
    <li>Frida Kahlo was born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón. </li>
    <li>At age 6, Frida was stricken with polio, which caused her right leg to appear much thinner than the other.  It was to remain that way permanently.
 </li>
    <li>In 1922, Frida entered the best educational institution in Mexico, the National Preparatory School.  It was there she first encountered Diego Rivera, who had been commissioned to pain a mural in the school’s auditorium.</li>
    <li>On September 17, 1925, Frida was involved in a serious bus accident, which left her with a broken spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, and 11 fractures in her right leg.  In addition, her right foot was dislocated and crushed, and her shoulder was out of joint.  She would undergo approximately 30 operations in her lifetime.</li>
    <li>Diego and Frida were married on August 21, 1929.  Their marriage has been called the union between an elephant and a dove, because Diego was huge and very fat, and Frida was small and slender.
 </li>
    <li>In 1937, Leon Trotsky was granted political asylum in Mexico, largely due to the efforts of Diego and Frida, and lived with them for the following two years.  Frida and Leon had a brief affair, and for his birthday Frida gave him a self-portrait.</li>
    <li>In 1946, she received a Mexican government fellowship, and in the same year an official prize on the occasion of the National Annual Exhibition.  She also took up teaching at the new experimental art school “La Esmeralda,” and, despite her unconventional methods, proved an inspiration to her students.</li>
    <li>All over the world, people loved Frida.  When she traveled to France, she was wined and dined by Picasso, and appeared on the cover of French Vogue.</li>
